# Dinosaur AI

This is a machine learning AI developed by the following:
    
    Shawn Hu - Markville S.S.
    Ian Li - Markville S.S.
    Noah Chan - Markville S.S.
    
This was a project that was done in our time and uses our current knowledge of
AI.

The network we used is a very simple Feed Forward network that consists of 3
input layers, 3 hidden nodes, and 1 output layer.

The AI was designed to play and achieve the highest score possible on Google's
dinosaur game that is available on Google Chrome when their is no internet.

The game is made by us and is not very well made. We simply needed a task for
our first machine-learning AI to learn to play.

The game in this gitlab.com repository is not a full copy of the Google
Dinosaur Game. No raptors or flying obstacles exist and graphics
are kept to a bare minimum.

Read the CHANGELOG.md file as it lists a lot of major changes and at which date
they were completed (not 100% accurate though).

Everythin was done from scratch so the training algorithm is very sketchy and
barely works.
