# Dinosaur AI

This is a machine learning AI developed by the following:
    
    Shawn Hu - Markville S.S.
    Ian Li - Markville S.S.
    Noah Chan - Markville S.S.
    
This was a project that was done in our time and uses our current knowledge of
neural networks.

The network we used is a very simple Feed Forward network that consists of 3
input layers, 3 hidden nodes, and 1 output layer.

The AI was designed to play and achieve the highest score possible on Google's
dinosaur game that is available on Google Chrome when their is no internet.

The game is made by us and probably has a crap ton of bugs that we will not fix
simply because we only made the game to fulfill our need for a task for the AI
to complete/do.

Read the CHANGELOG.md file as it lists a lot of major changes and at which date
they were completed.
